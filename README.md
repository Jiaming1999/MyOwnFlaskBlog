# MyOwnFlaskBlog
My own flask blog, collecting my thoughts and some beginner's idea on how flask works.


This repository is aiming at sharing my own feelings and thoughs on python flask usage to all beginners to backend development with python. 

How to install flask:
```
pip install flask
```

For My cs411 project using mySql as database, run this as well:
```
pip install flask-mysqldb
```
